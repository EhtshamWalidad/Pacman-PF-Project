# Pacman-PF-Project
I created a Pacman in my PF(Programming Fundamentals) project using basic logics of C++. 
We used arrows for Pacman Representation it changes w.r.t to arrows pressed.
8 number is used to reperesent ghosts and o for pellets.
There are total of 2 ghosts in this game 1 runs randomnly and 2 ghost runs with euclidean distance formula, which follows you and make the game more interesting.
If you collect all pellets you win!
